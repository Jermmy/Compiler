PHOENIX -- Kyrie Irving is back, and he definitely was needed on an off night for LeBron James.

Irving sank a 3-pointer as the shot clock expired with 21.9 seconds to play and the Cleveland Cavaliers held on to hand the Phoenix Suns their fifth loss in a row, 101-97 on Monday.

"It is a great feeling having the kid back," James said. "He does so much for our team."

Brandon Knight's 3-pointer cut Cleveland's lead to 96-95 with 1:27 to go and, after James missed a jumper, Knight hit another 3 but it was waved off because of an offensive foul against the Suns' Tyson Chandler.

The Cavs almost turned it over on their next possession but got the ball to Irving, who made a jumper from beyond the top of the key.

"J.R. Smith made an incredible winning play to save that ball," Cleveland coach David Blatt said. "That ball was going out of bounds and it looked like it would be their possession. He made a fabulous save. Kyrie made a huge shot."

Irving glanced at the clock and then coolly put the shot in the air.

"Those type of shots," he said, "it is just a calmness about it."

In his fourth game since returning from knee surgery, Irving also hit a 12-foot floater to put Cleveland ahead 96-92 with 1:44 to go.

Irving scored 22 points, Smith had 17 and Kevin Love added 16 for the Cavs, who ended a two-game skid. James had 14 points, only two on 0-for-3 shooting in the fourth quarter.

T.J. Warren scored 23 and Knight had 18 for the Suns, who earlier in the day announced they had fired assistant coaches Mike Longabardi and Jerry Sichting.

Nate Bjorkgren was promoted to take Longabardi's job as defensive coordinator. Assistant coach Earl Watson was promoted to a bench coach position.

Both teams were coming off their worst losses of the season. Cleveland was routed at Portland 105-76 on Saturday, the same night Phoenix lost an embarrassing one at home to Philadelphia 111-104.

In that defeat, the Suns lost leading scorer Eric Bledsoe to a torn meniscus in his left knee. The injury leaves Knight as the primary ball-handler for the next several weeks.

"We came out and fought the game all the way down to the last minute," Knight said, "so I think we put ourselves in a position to win or at least try to win. We've got to do a better job just correcting some things but I think the overall effort was better than it has been."

The Suns have lost 16 of their last 21, but at least this one provided reason for hope.

"It's still a loss," coach Jeff Hornacek said, "but it's encouraging that we're without Eric, we're out there a lot of time with Alex (Len) and Devin (Booker) and T.J., some of our young guys -- that's a good effort. You can't fault that."

The Cavs took the lead for good with 5 minutes remaining in the first half but never were up by more than 11.

MISSING MORRIS

The Suns were without forward Markieff Morris, who was serving the second of a two-game suspension for throwing a towel at Hornacek during a game against Denver last week.

REST UP

Irving will sit out Tuesday night's game at Denver to rest as he works his way back from knee surgery. It will be the third time he skips the second of back-to-back games since his return Dec. 20. Irving said he expects that to be the final time he misses the second of games on consecutive nights. Cleveland doesn't have another back-to-back situation until mid-January.
